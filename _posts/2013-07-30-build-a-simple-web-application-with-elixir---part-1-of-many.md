## Preambule

I love open source software, and I have an enormous respect for all contributors
to open source software. The world and more selfishly my life would be quite
different if people like Richard Stallman, Linus Torvald, Larry Wall,
Yukihiro Matsumoto, David Heinemeier Hansson, John Resig, Yehuda Katz,
Aaron Patterson, José Valim and so many more, had not dedicated so much of their
time and talent to building amazing languages and frameworks, but also knowledge
and "savoir faire".

I am very thankful to all the contributors to those goodies I use and abuse
everyday, both for my pleasure and for making a living. So I thought I would
try to give back, even if so little (you've got to start somewhere), by sharing
some of what I learn. Maybe it will save people some time, maybe it will give
ideas, and maybe some of my enthusiasm for Elixir, Ruby and other software
goodies will be contagious.

## Elixir

I am falling in love with Elixir, and it feels a lot like how I felt back in
2006 when I met Ruby and Rails and started learning Ruby. Thank you José Valim
for making the power of the Erlang ecosystem so accessible and taking it to
the next level by making it so enjoyable.
